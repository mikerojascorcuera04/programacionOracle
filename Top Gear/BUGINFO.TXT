Filing a useful bug report:

There's a few simple things you can do to help us
deal with your bug report more effectively.

Before reporting, check any recent bug reports on
the ZSNES boards, read the readme about unsupported
chips, and the bug tracker at
http://zsnes.sourceforge.net

First, We need version and port. It isn't helpful
for us to test a game that's "broken" if you are 
using 1.17b, and don't tell us that fact, because
we may have fixed it in 1.20 or later. Also, report
whether you are using ZSNESW, ZSNES linux, or ZSNES DOS.
Rarely, a problem is port specific, but reporting
the port used up front makes it much easier to get
a person with the proper port to test.

Second, a detailed name of the game is helpful. It
is common for a game to act different in different
regions. By explaining you're using a Us, European,
or Japanese version, you make testing signifcantly
easier, because we can test the exact game, rather
than picking which "Puzzle Bobble" you mean.

Third, describe the problem in detail. Is it an 
emulation bug? If not, can you reproduce it? If
it is an emulation bug, investigate. Does the
game lock up? Or does the sound fail? Are the
graphics wrong? Provide details. Toggle the
backgrounds or sound channels, and see if you can
find anything, like background 3 is corrupt, or
if offset-per-tile is messed up. Does the old
gfx engine act the same? Is a particular sound
channel sticking on?

When the game starts, does ZSNES say "OK" in the
checksum field?

Finally, do other emulators run the game correctly?

If you have any additional information, like when
the game may have quit working, or when another
emulator ran it, or a game that acts the same.

Thanks.

System specs are also nice, but less essential.
