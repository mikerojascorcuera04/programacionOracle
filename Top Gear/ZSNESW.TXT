ZSNESWin 1.35
---------------------------------------------
Use this version at your own risk.  The ZSNES team is not responsible
for any damages that might have occured using this software.

NOTE: If ZSNESWin crashes on you, first make sure that any major program
  is closed (such as WinAMP).  You also might need to download and install
  the newest DirectX located at www.microsoft.com/directx
NOTE2: If you find ZSNESWin to be a bit choppy and you have a decent
  machine (300mhz+), you might want to change your video modes in
  ZSNESWin until you find the optimal mode that runs at the optimal speed.

Usage:
------
- To move the window, you can either drag the top bar using the left mouse
  button in the GUI or hold the right mouse button anywhere in the GUI
- To move the mouse out of the ZSNESw window, move the mouse with extra speed
- The top-right corner has a close button and a maximize/minimize button
  which switches between the last selected (or default) windowed/full
  screen mode
- To use a joystick, go to Input #1 (or whichever input device you want to
  set) through the Config menu and then select the button you want to
  change.  Then just push the button or direction on your joystick that you
  want to use for that button.  Or you can just use the 'Set All' button to
  change the snes buttons/directions all at once.

Things you should know / Performance Issues:
--------------------------------------------
- To get the maximum possible performance from your system, try various
  video modes and see which one is right for you.  Certain video cards
  perform really slowly in the S modes while others perform just as
  fast on the S modes compared to the non-S modes.  If you're using
  a windowed mode, try setting your desktop to 16bit color
  for best performance.
- D windowed modes only work in 16bit color desktop resolutions
- Take note that the non-D video modes will not display high resolution
  games or effects.
- Scanlines don't work well in R video modes.

Currently known bugs (exclusive to the windows port):
-----------------------------------------------------
- Pressing alt-enter during gameplay doesn't work well (colors sometimes
  mess up, this is likely a driver issue)
- Alt-Enter only works with the left Alt key


Current limitations:
--------------------
- Windowed modes with a 'D' only works when the desktop is under a 16bit
  color mode
- 48000 sampling rate is disabled since we're not sure if the sound pitch
  of this mode is consistent throughout all soundcards.
- You cannot move the window off-screen
- You cannot use the 256 color video engines in the win port
